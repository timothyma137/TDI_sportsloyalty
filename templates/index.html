  <h3>The North American sports industry pulls in tens of billions of dollars every year. By understanding fan behaviors for different teams, different sports, and different sports markets around the U.S., owners will be able to gauge the monetary pros and cons of moving a franchise across the country. Companies will better evaluate the value in sponsorships and advertisements. The presidents and managers of these teams will be able to predict whether improving their roster actually leads to profit. We also get to see which sports and which cities are most loyal to their teams.</h3>

  <h2 class="margin">The Data</h2>
  <h3>Data was collected from 14 different sources for the four major sports:  football, basketball, baseball, and hockey between 2001 and 2017. This included latitude, longitude, city, TV market, TV market size, win/loss records, ticket price, and attendance records. Ticket prices are adjusted for inflation. Especially troublesome were the many ways that a team can be referred to. For example, the New England Patriots can be referred to as “Patriots”, “New England” or “Boston” in different data sources. More trouble comes from teams that have moved, changed their name, or in the special case of the Charlotte Hornets who moved to become the New Orleans Hornets, then the Charlotte Bobcats are born in 2004, and when the New Orleans Hornets change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans, the Charlotte Bobcats decided to change their name to the Charlotte Hornets. Whew! </h3>

  <h3>How does attendance depend on team success? For football and baseball, there’s not much of a relationship. Football consistently has very high attendance no matter how teams perform, while baseball has a wide range of attendance that doesn’t depend on wins and losses. As a whole, basketball and hockey each have a slight correlation that indicates that winning more games leads to higher attendance.

When looking at the totality of all sports, it appears that higher ticket prices correlate with higher attendance, but this only happens because of the segmentation in the sports. Baseball attendance varies greatly with low prices, while football has high attendance with high prices. Hockey and basketball fill out the center with middle ticket prices and relatively high attendance with only some ticket prices rivaling those of football.

  <h3>Click around on this interactive map. The size of the circle dictates high average attendance for a sport for a year against its league average. The color of the circle dictates fan loyalty given by attendance/ win percentage starting with white as the lowest loyalty, then pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, to black as the highest loyalty. This places a high value on fans who go to games despite losing seasons. <br />
      <br />
      
      Boston sports teams consistently have the highest average attendance, but that can be explained by recent dominance in all of their sports. Tampa Bay has the lowest attendance of any city, while Phoenix has the lowest attendance of any city with all four major sports. <br />
      <br />

Raleigh-Durham with their Carolina Hurricanes hockey team has the worst loyalty, and San Antonio also has a low score, but that is because they only have one team and that one team is the consistently winning San Antonio Spurs. Phoenix once again has the poorest loyalty for a city with four sports. Atlanta and Pittsburg are not so hot either. On the opposite side, Jacksonville and St. Louis have very loyal fans, while Detroit has the most loyal fans for a city with all four sports followed by Washington D.C., although Washington D.C. is known to have many fans from the opposing team to come and watch games.

<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">
  <h2 class="margin">Methodology behind an Attendance Predictor</h2>
  <h3>Each team and each year account for a single data point. When a team moves, those teams are then considered as the end of one team and the start of a new. Teams that have simply changed their name are considered the same team. If a team for a certain year is missing its attendance figures or ticket figures, that data point is thrown out. With 128 teams in the four sports and 17 years of records, I reduced the data down to city, sport, attendance for a year, ticket price for a year, and win percentage for a year. <br />
      <br />

My pipeline consists of a row iterator, a dictionary vectorizer,
  followed by a random forest regressor. The resulting model predicts
  that with outrageously high ticket prices, attendance will
  skyrocket, so that variable was removed. Cross Validation scores the
  model to have an R^2 of 0.7. The model predicts the attendance of a sport in a city at a certain win percentage. We can create new teams such as a basketball team returning to Seattle or a football team in Orlando. </h3>

  <h3>	Timothy Ma received his Ph.D. in physics from UC Irvine in 2017 following receiving Bachelor Degrees in Astronomy and Physics from UC Berkeley. He was heavily involved in campus affairs between 2012-2017 including serving a term as President of the Associated Graduate Students to represent the 5,500 graduate and professional students.  His dissertation research focused on a quantum biology theory that models how certain animals may be able to detect Earth’s magnetic field and use it to navigate. This included developing an iPhone app titled MagneticVR where people can experience the sense of magnetic vision in a virtual reality world through the use of a Google Cardboard headset. He completed the Data Incubator Fellowship as part of the 2018 summer cohort.
